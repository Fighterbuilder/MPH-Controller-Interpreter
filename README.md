# MPH-Controller-Interpreter
 A controller-to-mouse interpreter purpose-built for playing Metroid Prime Hunters in the melonDS emulator.

 This project seeks to provide a new, more comfortable, and competitively-viable way to play Metroid Prime Hunters, as its reliance on touchscreen controls make interpretation difficult in general-purpose controller macro software such as JoyToKey, and can often lead to hand cramps when playing on original hardware.
